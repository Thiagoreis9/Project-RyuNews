# RyunewsBlog

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.1.2.

In this project challenge of the Cloud Fullstack Bootcamp - Warburg Pincus taught by Felipe Silva Aguiar, I baptized the blog as "RyuNews". I put into practice all the fundamentals of Angular that I learned during the course and I made the entire layout of the home page based on dribbble and the content page based on the layout of the flowgames news site. I also implemented responsiveness for compatibility with mobile devices, tablets and smart tv's. I took the opportunity and put a label that redirects to another project carried out during the bootcamp, in this case "PokeDex".
